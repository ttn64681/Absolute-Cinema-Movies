## Slide 2: Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Java 17+ | Spring Boot 3.x

## Slide 3: Architecture Overview

**Architectural Patterns:**
- **Backend**: Layered Architecture (N-Tier)
- **Frontend**: Component-Based Architecture
- **Communication**: Client-Server via REST API

**Backend Layers:**
1. API/Controller Layer → Handles HTTP, returns JSON
2. Business Logic Layer → Services with business rules
3. Data Access Layer → Repositories + Entities

**Note**: Layered Architecture (internal structure) + Client-Server (communication) are complementary

## Slide 4: System Decomposition

**Backend Decomposition:**
```
Controller Layer
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repository Layer + Entities
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL)
```

**Frontend Decomposition:**
```
Components (UI)
    ↓
Hooks + Contexts (State/Logic)
    ↓
API Facades (movieClient.ts)
    ↓
HTTP Client (Axios)
```

**Communication**: REST API between frontend and backend

## Slide 6: Facade Pattern - Definition & Problem

**Pattern Definition:**
Provides a **unified interface** to a **complex subsystem** with many classes/interfaces.

**Key Components:**
1. **Facade**: Single class that provides simplified interface
2. **Subsystem**: Complex set of classes/interfaces (API config, HTTP client, utils)
3. **Client**: Components that use the facade (don't know about subsystem complexity)

**What It Does:**
- Hides complexity behind simple interface
- Reduces coupling between clients and subsystem
- Provides single entry point to multiple operations

**Problem:**
- - Code duplication across components
- - Tight coupling to API endpoints
- - Mixed concerns in hooks (API + state)
- - No reusability (can't use in server-side)

---

## Slide 7: Facade Pattern - Solution & SOLID

**Solution:**
- + `movieClient.ts` facade: Single interface for all movie operations
- + Separates API logic from React state
- + Reusable across components, hooks, server-side
- + Centralized error handling & transformation

**Implementation:**
- Create MovieClient class with methods: getMovies, searchMovies, getMovieDetails, getShowtimes
- Each method handles URL building, HTTP requests, error handling, and response transformation internally
- Hooks use MovieClient instead of direct API calls
- All API complexity hidden from components

**Class Diagram:**
```
Components → MovieClient (Facade) → API Config/HTTP/Utils → Backend API
```

**SOLID Principles:**
1. **SRP**: MovieClient = API access only | useMovies = state only
   - *Before: useMovies did API + state + caching*
   - *After: MovieClient does API, useMovies does state*
2. **DIP**: Components depend on MovieClient abstraction, not concrete API
   - *Before: Components depend on `/api/movies/browse/now-playing`*
   - *After: Components depend on `movieClient.getMovies()`*
3. **OCP**: Can extend facade with new methods without modifying existing code
   - *Can add `getMovieReviews()` without changing `getMovies()`*

**Design Goals:**
- + Maintainability: Centralized logic
- + Reusability: Single source of truth
- + Testability: Easy to mock

---

## Slide 8: Decorator Pattern - Definition & Problem

**Pattern Definition:**
Attaches **additional responsibilities** to an object **dynamically** by **wrapping** it, without modifying the base object.

**Key Components:**
1. **Base Component**: Core object with basic functionality (MovieCard)
2. **Decorator**: Wrapper that adds behavior (withBookingActions, withComingSoonBanner)
3. **Client**: Uses decorated component (doesn't know it's wrapped)

**What It Does:**
- Wraps object to add behavior
- Maintains same interface as wrapped object
- Can compose multiple decorators
- Allows runtime behavior modification

**Problem:**
- - Conditional rendering complexity (showBooking, showAdmin props)
- - Tight coupling: Component knows all use cases
- - Hard to extend: Adding variant requires modifying base
- - Violates Open/Closed Principle

---

## Slide 9: Decorator Pattern - Solution & SOLID

**Solution:**
- + Base `MovieCard`: Core rendering only
- + Decorators: `withBookingActions`, `withComingSoonBanner`, `withAdminControls`
- + Composable: Can combine decorators
- + Base unchanged when adding new behaviors

**Implementation:**
- Base MovieCard renders only poster, title, genres (no conditional logic)
- Each decorator is a function that takes MovieCard component and returns wrapped version
- Decorator renders base component plus additional UI elements (buttons, banners, controls)
- Usage: const NowPlayingCard = withBookingActions(MovieCard)
- Can compose: withAdminControls(withBookingActions(MovieCard))

**Class Diagram:**
```
MovieCard (Base)
    ↑
Decorators: withBookingActions | withComingSoonBanner | withAdminControls
```

**SOLID Principles:**
1. **SRP**: Base = core rendering | Each decorator = one behavior
   - *Before: MovieCard handled booking + admin + coming soon*
   - *After: MovieCard = rendering, each decorator = one feature*
2. **OCP**: Base closed for modification | Open for extension via decorators
   - *Before: Add new variant = modify MovieCard*
   - *After: Add new variant = create new decorator*
3. **ISP**: Clients use base for simple cases | Specific decorators for specific needs
   - *Simple case: Use MovieCard directly*
   - *Need booking: Use withBookingActions(MovieCard)*

**Design Goals:**
- + Maintainability: Base unchanged
- + Reusability: Composable decorators
- + Extensibility: Easy to add new decorators

---

## Slide 10: Protected Proxy Pattern - Definition & Problem

**Pattern Definition:**
Provides a **surrogate/placeholder** that **controls access** to another object based on **permissions/authorization**.

**Key Components:**
1. **Proxy**: Intercepts requests, checks permissions (Middleware, RouteProtection)
2. **Real Subject**: Actual object being protected (Protected Component, Controller Endpoint)
3. **Client**: Makes request (doesn't know about proxy)

**What It Does:**
- Intercepts requests before they reach real subject
- Enforces access control rules
- Blocks or forwards requests based on permissions
- Client interacts with proxy, not real subject directly

**Problem:**
- - Backend protected + | Frontend routes not fully protected -
- - Admin can navigate to public pages
- - Protection happens after render (poor UX)
- - Security gap: Backend protects APIs, frontend doesn't protect routes

---

## Slide 11: Protected Proxy Pattern - Solution & SOLID

**Solution:**
- + Backend: `JwtAuthenticationFilter` + `SecurityFilterChain` (already implemented)
- + Frontend: Next.js Middleware (server-side proxy) + RouteProtection HOC (client-side proxy)
- + Defense in depth: Multiple layers of protection
- + Redirects before render (better UX)

**Implementation:**
- Backend: JwtAuthenticationFilter intercepts all HTTP requests, validates JWT token, sets SecurityContext
- Backend: SecurityFilterChain checks user role, enforces endpoint permissions, returns 403 if unauthorized
- Frontend: Next.js middleware.ts intercepts route requests, checks JWT from cookies, validates role, redirects if unauthorized
- Frontend: RouteProtection HOC wraps protected components, checks auth state, blocks render if unauthorized
- Both proxies forward to real subject only if authorized

**Class Diagram:**
```
Client → Middleware/RouteProtection (Proxy) → Protected Component/Route
Backend: Client → JwtFilter/SecurityChain (Proxy) → Controller Endpoints
```

**SOLID Principles:**
1. **SRP**: Proxy = access control only | Real subject = business logic only
   - *Proxy: Only checks permissions*
   - *Real Subject: Only handles business logic*
2. **ISP**: Proxy implements same interface as real subject
   - *Both have same interface, client doesn't know which one*
   - *Can swap proxy/real subject without client changes*
3. **DIP**: Client depends on abstraction, not proxy vs real subject
   - *Client depends on component interface*
   - *Proxy and real subject both implement same interface*

**Design Goals:**
- + Security: Defense in depth
- + Usability: Redirects before render
- + Maintainability: Centralized access control
